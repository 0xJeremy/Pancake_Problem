These are two solutions to the classic pancake flipping problem. The A*
algorithm uses artificial intelligence to determine the optimal number of
flips. The Dijkstra algorithm solves the same problem, but in substancially
more time.

Usage:
	Required modules:
		Networkx: ~/$ pip install networkx

	Running:
		~/$ python astar.py
		~/$ python dijkstra.py
